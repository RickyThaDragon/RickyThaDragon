Hello GitHub Community! My name is Ricky Henager,my online pseudonym is RickyThaDragon. Im 48 yrs old and live in the United States (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
I started out learning about hackintosh about 3yrs ago and had no experience in programming editing,modding or anything of the like. With self perserverance 
I have up to this point taught myself what I know from devouring forums "Dortania Guide" as my base for 90% of my knowledge and various other forums thourghout the 
Internet such as applelife.ru and many others. You have to start somewhere in order to get started doing anything and so I after three yrs of hackintoshing 
everyday and tearing my system down thousands of times and putting it back together I have learned quite a bit more than I anticipated. 
       I have alot of freetime on my hands right now and would like to use that time not only to better myself but to help and give back to the communuity
       of developers and all alike who have contributed there time and efforts to ensure that others had a smooth transition into the world of hackintoshing
       and that the learning curves were made as smooth as possible. I do think that as a whole that this has been a outcome for anyone who is 
       really wanting to learn and will read forums and instructions in their entirety. So with that said ill give a short description of my areas of 
       knowledge and if these areas are useful to anyone that may need any assistance in maintaining any projects or just needs assistance in any areas 
       know that I am open to lending a hand if I can possibly help. 
                    My list here isnt big or isnt by ny means on the level of many ob github but I have to start somewhere and so here it goes.
                    These are the things I am in my opinion good at as far as hackintosh goes. 
                    1) DSDT-patching, error removing, injection etc. (credits of study:rehabman patches and tutorials,ive read alot of maldons tutorials and deciphered
                    what was decipherable out of them,not an easy task by the way seeing as he doesnt offer much of any explanation at all to his visuals and his writing is cryptic
                    but none the less i gathered quite a bit from them. For Example when You watch a YouTube Video on say a "DSDT Patch by Maldon You are given no explanation to any of the blur
                    of text that flys by and quote does its thing. So when I have to go login to Windows and load up the "PotPlayer" to watch the video after i download
                    the video from youtube and make sure its in 1080p otherwise it will still be a blur, potplayer allowed me to slow down the video and move threw it
                    frame by frame while keeping everything that was on the screen intact andreadable. I had to do all this just to see what the hell was being injected from the 
                    said txt file on the tutorial which was not provided in any of the downloadable links. But thats how I learned from those scenarios. 
                    So thats why i say it was a difficult path but i made the best of it and it helped. 
                    2)SSDTS- am able to write my own SSDTS credits Dortania
                    3)Currently learning a lil about CSS just started that adventure. 
                    4)As for the rest of hackintosh Im good at troubleshooting and fixing others boot problems, config plist issues and making their system boot and work correctly
                    with either SSDT and sometimes DSDT. Mostly SSDT seems to work the easiest when working on others PCs over the airwaves. DSDT is more of a personal
                    thing that ive tinkered with and it has helped me expand my knowledge in many many ways so for that much I am grateful.
                    
                    So thanks for reading if you made it this far . I dont know if ive said too much or too little. I am new to all of this
                    So any suggestions are accepted and any projects or help needed or if someone just wants to take the time bless me with some knowledge 
                    feel free to send it my way. Thanks again everyone and have a great day!
                                                                                                     Sincerely: RickyThaDragon (7/23/2022)
